# Reporting Security Issues

To report a vulnerability or security issue with any of my projects, please use GitHubâ€™s Security Advisory tool to report it. You can access this from the **Security** tab in the repository and clicking **Report a vulnerability**.

If reporting is not available for this repository, the issue can be [reported to the default security advisory](https://github.com/cmbuckley/.github/security).
